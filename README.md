This is a project related to applications of digital image processing. the project deals with processing a number plate image to gain the number plate value from the image and then print those values as an output. The project uses MATLAB software with the Computer visual pack downloaded as it provides a much easier method to deal with the computer vision part of the project, since that part is available as a library in said pack.

THe main Thing that i was having a problem with was the order and choice of filters and other steps within the pre-processing stage of the image. but i think ihave them figured out now.

also, sometimes, the OCR might misinterpret some numbers or alphabets, due to their close similarities to other numbers and such. for example showing "5" as "S" and "1" as "7" and so on. you can get better outputs by calibrating some filter values by yourself if you want.
