This is a project related to applications of digital image processing. the project deals with processing a number plate image to gain the number plate value from the image and then print those values as an output. The project uses MATLAB software with the Computer visual pack downloaded as it provides a much easier method to deal with the computer vision part of the project, since that part is available as a library in said pack.

THe main THing that i was having a problem with was the order and choice of filters and other steps within the pre-processing stage of the image. but i think ihave them figured out now.
